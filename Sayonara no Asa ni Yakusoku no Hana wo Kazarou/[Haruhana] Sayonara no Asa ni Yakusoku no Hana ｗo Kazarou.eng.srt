[clicking]

00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:04,544
[girl] The warp of a loom
is like the flow of time.

4
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,629
It changes seasons,

5
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,090
dyes the sky anew.

6
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,968
The weft comprises
a man's deeds,

7
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:15,054
their tread upon the earth,

8
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,640
the shift of their heart

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,852
and the Iorph weave
the days together.

10
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,231
Weaving the story
of their world

11
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,026
through the many long
centuries of their life.

12
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:36,159
[laughing]

13
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:44,042
Maquia!

14
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,298
Leilia!

15
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,426
What are you
doing down there?

16
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,636
We're never going to finish
with you playing around.

17
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,597
[laughing]

18
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:58,598
Jump in, Maquia!

19
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:01,142
You can do it, just fly!

20
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,063
[Maquia] I... I can't.

21
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:09,150
You're scared.

22
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:15,198
It's all right. Better not to
get caught up in her mischief.

23
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:16,407
You're right.

24
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,618
[boy] That Leilia,

25
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,703
she will never learn.

26
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:32,965
[Maquia] Those that make a life
of weaving this cloth,

27
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:36,636
far from the lands of man,
have a name...

28
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,640
"the Clan of the Separated".

29
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:47,105
[woman] Is something
the matter, Lady Racine?

30
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,693
[Racine] Nothing.

31
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:55,488
Just you wait, next time
you're going in, too.

32
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:58,449
[bell tolls]

33
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,201
[gasps] Mother!

34
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,247
Welcome home.

35
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:07,417
[Mother] Leilia you mustn't
treat the cloth like that.

36
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,876
Sorry, Mama.

37
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,795
Now why exactly
are you all wet?

38
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:13,131
Did you find any
good flowers, Father?

39
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:15,842
Indeed, these will
make a rich violet.

40
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:20,430
See you later!
Bye, Maquia!

41
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,473
See ya later.

42
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:29,605
See you later.

43
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:37,822
A tear.

44
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,546
Why are you crying,
little one?

45
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,966
Because I'm alone.

46
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,342
Alone?

47
00:03:58,342 --> 00:03:59,927
Even with me beside you?

48
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,722
[gasps] No, elder,
that's not what In

49
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:07,602
You always were
quick to tears.

50
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,354
Maquia, do you know
why we call ourselves

51
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:13,483
-"the Clan of the Separated"?
-Hmm?

52
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,152
To outsiders,
we are but fairy tales,

53
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:18,446
we are longer lived
than any other race,

54
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:23,451
but despite that fact,
we seemingly remain
eternally youthful.

55
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:26,287
Only a few centuries past,

56
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:29,707
an existence such as ours
would be commonplace,

57
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:33,544
there was a clan that
unfurled wings like a bird's,

58
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:36,172
there were flowers that
would sing at daybreak,

59
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:40,343
leviathans would carry
cargo across the seas.

60
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:44,764
But now, all of that magic,

61
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:47,892
that wonder,
has departed the world.

62
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,353
[sighs]

63
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:55,775
That is why the Separated must
always weave the Hibial cloth.

64
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:59,070
You will never be alone here.

65
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,616
Memories dwindle and fade
with the passing of years,

66
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:07,286
the Hibial will always remember.

67
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:10,998
The people who enter
and depart our lives,

68
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:15,461
they weep within
its fabric with you.

69
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:18,047
They are weeping with me?

70
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:20,967
[Racine] Maquia...

71
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,594
if ever you must leave
the Iorph behind...

72
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,513
[Maquia] Huh?

73
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:29,475
...if you should ever meet
someone from the outside,

74
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,186
you must never fall in love.

75
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:37,149
For if you fall to love,
you'll be truly alone.

76
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,151
Oh, but if I meet someone,

77
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,988
then how could I
be left alone?

78
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:43,864
Such is our fate,

79
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:48,619
why we must always remain
the Clan of the Separated.

80
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:52,999
[Maquia] Goodnight, elder.

81
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,543
[Racine] Sleep well, Maquia.

82
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,713
And be sure not to forget
to weave your Hibial for today.

83
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,214
Of course.

84
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:30,202

00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,994
Anybody!

102
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,872

[all shout]

[man 1] It looks like
the rumors are true.

105
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,953
They really do
look like children.

106
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:22,124
[man 2] Yeah, this must look
great to a deviant like you.

109
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:41,727
Who leads this village?

110
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:48,150
You're the elder?

111
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,611
It is an honor to meet you.

112
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,198
You may look like a young girl,
but I know what you are.

113
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:58,202
The stories say you are
a monster over 400 years old.

114
00:09:58,202 --> 00:10:01,956
You will find no monsters here,
Commander, only weavers,

115
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:04,416
who bind the cloth of days.

116
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,752
Such is our fate
and I shall not permit you--

117
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:09,880
[Izor] I am afraid you have
no choice in the matter.

118
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,678
It is by order of the king
you shall accompany me
to the palace of Mezarte.

119
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:18,097
You won't lay a hand

You're Maquia, right?

157
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,385
I came to buy some Hibial but...

158
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,554
[chuckles]
...that didn't work out.

159
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:29,848
This place was
a drifter's settlement.

160

Got raided by bandits. This
little guy was only hours old.

That's pretty amazing.
I guess that's what mothers do.

Even in death,
she tries to protect her child.

163

Well, leave the kid here.

they'll meet up again in heaven.

Better than being alone.

168
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,381
[gulping]

169
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:05,467
[Maquia] He's...
he's really alone?

170
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:16,645
[gasps]

171
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:30,159
[grunting]

172
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,459
Oh, she's...

173
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,129
She's so strong.

174
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,464
Come on now, don't do that.

175
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:57,102
[man] You're really going
to take him with you?

176
00:15:57,102 --> 00:16:00,189
-He's not a toy.
-[Maquia] I know he's not a toy.

177
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,941
He's my...

178
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,028
He's my Hibial.

179
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:11,617
A lone child
meets another lone child,

180
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,661
and so they set off
into the world.

181
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,334
Are you cold?

182
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,512
You smell funny.

183
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:36,433
You smell like the sun.

184
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:44,191
Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms

185
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,110
[boy 1 grunting]

186
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,779
[boy 2] You'll never
take me alive!

187
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,489
-[laughing]
-[boy 1] Get back here!

188
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,700
[woman] Lang, Deol,
that's enough now.

189
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,744
-[grunts]
-[cries out]

190
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,454
-[Deol] You didn't
watch your back, Lang!
-Get back here!

191
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:00,332
-I'm gonna get you!
-Those boys just never listen.

192
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:01,833
-[dog barking]
-Hm?

193
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,836
What's wrong, Anora?

194
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:13,553
-[sheep bleating]
-[baby coos]

195
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,722
-Huh?

196
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,645
-I don't understand.
-[woman] What?

197
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:26,400
How do these--
I don't know how these work.

198
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,568
I can't...

199
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:34,992
[woman] What a mess.

200
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:38,161
A child is not meant
to raise another child.

201
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:45,168
Is that baby even yours?

202
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:54,219
They say you can't tell how old
Iorphs are by how they look.
Is he yours?

203
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,098
Hey, off with the both of you.

204
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:01,268
I'm-I'm 15.

205
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:05,397
But the baby, he's...
I don't know.

206
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,982
[baby crying]

207
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:19,619
-[woman] What's his name?
-[Maquia] I don't know.

208
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,624
"Super weird and she's weird
And the kid's weird"

209
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:26,543
Leilia!

210
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:29,254
Leilia.

211
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:33,425
But that's a girl's name.
He should have a boy's name.

212
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:37,012
Leili, Elli,

213
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,805
Elia...

214
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,724
[gasps] Erial!

215
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,184
-Huh?
-Let go of me!

216
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:45,354
[sighs] Well,
I suppose that'll do.

217
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,152
[woman] She's a distant
relative.

218
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:53,862
She knows how to weave.

219
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:56,365
Mmm...

220
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:06,416
There's a loom that's gone
unused in the back of the shop.

221
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,794
She's welcome to that.

222
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,132
Take him outside.

223
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,513
She's an Iorph, isn't she?

224
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:23,725
I never could trick you, Darel.
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,356
Iorph cloth fetches
quite a high price.

226
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:32,234
She'll end up making me
a fair bit of coin.

227
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:34,653
Don't worry,
I won't say a word.

228
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,530
Thank you, Darel.

229
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,950
However, you've taken
in an Iorph girl,

230
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,452
trouble will be finding
you soon enough.

231
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:46,790
Maybe so, but no one can say
what the future will bring
to us,

232
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,502
such is life,
with or without her.

233
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:58,301
Here you are,
this week's freshest.

234
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,887
Thank you as always, Mido.

235
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:04,891
Mm! Your cheese has
the most wonderful flavor.

236
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:07,060
Oh, who's the new girl?

237
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,104
[Mido] I'll be back next week,
thanks so much.

238
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:11,064
Just a good, solid,
cheesy taste, you know?

239
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:15,610
[Mido] And the week after that.
Farewell now.

240
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,280
You know, raising a child
is never easy.

241
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,574
Even I couldn't do it alone.

242
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:22,534
You do understand that?

243
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,077
[Maquia] Mm.

244
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:26,580
[Mido] My husband passed on
some time ago,

245
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,499
killed by a Renato
with the red eye.

246
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:34,337
I don't know.

247
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:37,215
There's nothing wrong
with that.

248
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:40,469
I don't know what it means
to be a mother.

249
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,887
I never...

250
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:44,723
had one.

251
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,017
Well, it's all about guts.

252
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:51,313
[laughing]

253
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,026
[giggling]

254
00:21:58,213 --> 00:21:59,422
[babbles]

255
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,759
He's doing it!

256
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,761
He can walk!

257
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:06,805
[Maquia] Erial.

258
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:09,349
[laughing]

259
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:11,476
Erial's walking!

260
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,645
Erial can walk!

261
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:16,606
[Doel] Whoo-hoo!

262
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:21,403
-[a|l laughing]
-It looks like someone's
become quite the mama.

263
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,865
Am I really a mother?

264
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,575
[laughing]

265
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:30,245
If you were a mother,
I think you would know it.

266
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:34,416
Did you boys clean up
the goat barn or spend
all day fooling around?

267
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:38,044
-[Deol] Lang, Mom's coming!
-We gotta go. Come on run!

268
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:40,964
[Lang] I'm sorry, Mom.

269
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:42,215
[Deol] We meant to do it.

270
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:44,384
[Mido] Oh, you will be sorry.

271
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,054
[Deol] Ow.

272
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:53,601
Say "mommy", I know you can.

273
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:55,228
[babbles]

274
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:59,024
Sorry, you don't have to.

275
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,067
[Erial] Mama.

276
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,820
Erial, did you just say...

277
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,489
[babbles]

278
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:07,949
Say it again.

279
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,286
Say it one more time.

280
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,997
[Erial coos]

281
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:15,915
[geese honking]

282
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,585
[bell tolls]

283
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:23,340
[Izor] Another Renato has been
stricken with the red eye.

284
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,926
We shall put it down
and incinerate the body
in quarantine,

285
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,970
then bury it deep
beneath the earth.

286
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,806
Only five remain to us.

287
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:34,559
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

288
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,020
We need a cure
and we need it now, my liege.

289
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,439
The strength of the Renato
is the symbol of Mezarte,

290
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,566
it's the only force
we can afford to deploy.

291
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:45,779
When the last of the Renato
falls, the other kingdoms
will not hesitate.

292
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,323
Hmm... if they cannot be saved,

293
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:50,408
we will need a power
to replace the Renato,

294
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:53,453
something of equal
wonder and might that
will keep them at bay.

295
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,080
Yes, of course!

296
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,040
We have been granted
the chosen blood.

297
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,042
It will keep us safe.

298
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:02,295
[man] Commander,
what of the Iorph girl
that you captured?

299
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:05,840
How does she fare
as consort to Prince Hazel?

300
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,845
Tell me, please.

301
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:13,765
If you all have wings...

302
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:17,268
tell me, why you don't fly away?

303
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:21,815
[low growl]

304
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:24,275
You're afraid

305
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:27,987
you will wither and die here.

306
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:31,658
All the emotion you trap inside
will burn away,

307
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:35,662
your heart will catch fire
and you will burn to cinders.

308
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:39,416
[Izor] Lady Leilia,
the king has summoned you.

309
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,252
[Leilia] One moment more.

310
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:45,672
[Izor] Lady Leilia,
why are you drawn here?

311
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:49,676
It reminds me
of the Hibial tower.

312
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:52,512
So it does.

313
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:10,697
It's done.
Does it say anything?

314
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:13,700
Yeah, it says,
"Anora, feel better soon."

315
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,452
Perfect!

316
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:17,662
You know,
back where Mama was born,

317
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:21,541
we'd use cloth to say how
we felt instead of using words.

318
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,626
Where were you born, Mom?

319
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:25,753
Is it the same place I was born?

320
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:32,177
Dida's mom says you're different
from everybody else,
but I don't think so.

321
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:35,513
Where you were born,
little Erial,

322
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:38,057
everybody would talk
with their tummies

323
00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:40,143
before the tickling bug
would get them.

324
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:42,187
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

325
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,273
-But, Mom--
-Then we'd fly away.

326
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,317
[cow moos]

327
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:49,194
[Erial] Anora!

328
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:51,279
[Maquia] Be gentle
with him, OK?

329
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,869
Aren't you a lucky puppy?

330
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:01,748
Anora's been here ever since
Mom and Dad got married.

331
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:06,252
That puppy is almost
90 years old in dog years.

332
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:19,516
[boy] Hey, Erial,
why's your mom so weird?

333
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:22,185
Why's she always sneaking
around the village?

334
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:25,063
She is not weird!
My mommy--

335
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,981
I mean, my mom is--

336
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:28,399
She's just...

337
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:30,902
-[laughing]
-The baby can't talk.

338
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:33,154
And then he needs to run home
to his mommy.

339
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:35,156
You're the one
who's weird, Erial.

340
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:38,326
-Huh?
-Boy's aren't supposed
to like their moms, stupid.

341
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:41,579
That's not true.
You don't know.

342
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:45,792
-Dita, I hate you!
-[boy] I like my mom.

343
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:49,003
-[boy 2] Oh, shut up, you.
-[Eria|] I hate you! I hate you!

344
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:54,592
Hmm. [sniffles]

345
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,720
Wait, are you crying, Dita?

346
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,806
-[Dita grunts]
-[cries out]

347
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:06,729
Hmm, impressive work.

348
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,442
Here, this month's pay.

349
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:13,111
Thank you so much, Darel.

350
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:16,114
Actually, I'd like you
to take a look at something.

351
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:21,578
A customer of mine brought in
some true Hibial, here.

352
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:25,707
[gasps]

353
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:32,463
[Mido] Maquia?

354
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:34,549
"Held within the castle.

355
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:37,510
And to be wed to-to the prince."

356
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,512
It's beautiful.

357
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:41,514
Leilia!

358
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:45,476
[Mido gasps]

359
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:49,397
Don't worry,
Darel will look into it.

360
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:51,899
If anyone can get you
on a ship, it's him.

361
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,818
[woman] Quiet,
it's that Maquia girl.

362
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:56,404
[Mido] Maybe it's for the best.
For now at least.

363
00:27:56,404 --> 00:27:59,616
What are you going
to do with Erial?

364
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:02,744
[Maquia] Huh?

365
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:06,414
The journey won't be easy,
ever more so
with a young child in tow.

366
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:10,501
Besides, you have more
than a journey ahead.

367
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,838
You know I'd gladly
watch over him.

368
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:15,673
[Erial] Morn! Mommy!

369
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:17,634
[Maquia] Erial!

370
00:28:18,635 --> 00:28:20,428
[shovel digging]

371
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,681
[Erial crying]

372
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:33,107
Don't dig too deep, OK?

373
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:36,194
Just in case Anora
wants to come back and--

374
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:40,448
Dummy. You don't want wild
animals to dig her up, right?

375
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:42,825
[grunts] It's time.

376
00:28:55,838 --> 00:28:58,132
I won't be able to see her
in the ground.

377
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:01,094
You can see her
anytime you come here.

378
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:04,222
But we won't be able
to play together.

379
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,641
Tell her
she's a good dog.

380
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:09,185
She died in peace
without any pain.

381
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:12,939
And everybody is going to die,
eventually.

382
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:18,236
Anora was born into a life
where it happens faster
than it does for us.

383
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,029
[crying]

384
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:24,909
Maquia!

385
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:26,828
I'll go after her.

386
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:34,460
Does... does everybody die?

387
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,296
-Yes.
-Even moms?

388
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:39,549
Yes.

389
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:47,014
[Lang] Maquia!
Hey, please wait.

390
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:54,981
[crying] Erial.

391
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:57,942
Everyone, it's not fair.

392
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:59,402
You'll all have to...

393
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:03,156
You'll leave and
I'll-I'll still be here.

394
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:06,242
-Maquia...
-I knew it would happen,

395
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:10,413
I knew it,
but it's not fair, it's not.

396
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,251
It doesn't matter
that it isn't fair.

397
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,005
Stop crying!

398
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:22,467
You'll be gone, too.

399
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:26,012
Come on, you are Erial's mother,
aren't you?

400
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:29,265
Moms don't cry, you hear me?

401
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,975
My mom wouldn't.

402
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:34,645
So I know for sure
that moms don't cry.

403
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:41,194
OK.

404
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:43,571
Don't cry.

405
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:46,657
I promise.

406
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:49,327
Me too.

407
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:56,167
-[Lang] Good night.
-[Maquia] Sleep well.

[gasps] Erial!

409
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,681
You tried to wait up for me.

410
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:12,058
Let's get you to bed, OK?

411
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,102
[sleepy moan]

412
00:31:19,482 --> 00:31:22,693
You're getting big now, Erial,

413
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:26,656
but you still
smell like the sun.

414
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:29,575
I won't cry, OK?

415
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:32,161
I will always be your mother.

416
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:34,997
We will always be together.

417
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:38,000
I promise.

418
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,546
I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean it.
I'm really sorry.

419
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:45,383
I'm sorry about everything.
I really didn't mean...

420
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:50,596
I'm really, really sorry
and I wanna be friends again.

421
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:53,808
Um, Erial and his mom
had to leave.

422
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,820
[Erial] You're sure you don't
wanna say goodbye?

423
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:27,008
-[Erial] I wanna see the ocean.
-Erial, come back! You can't!

424
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:30,803
You told me
you would be a good boy.

425
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:34,390
Come back and stay with Mom.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

426
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,688
Maquia, is that you?

427
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:44,066
Oh, I can hardly believe
you're alive.

428
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:47,695
[Maquia] I never thought
I'd see you again.

429

[grunting]

430
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:55,995
It was our blood.

431
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:59,874
Mezarte attacked to discover
the secret of our long life,

432
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:02,043
that's why they came.

433
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:04,337
Stole Leilia.

434
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,839
Hey, Mom,
who is he talking about?

435
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,508
You have him calling
you his mother?

[both gasp]

437

No, it's not like that,
I just...

438
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,016
I'm not angry,
you're not wrong to.

439
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:19,852
It's just hard to forget
what the elder used to say.

440
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:24,523
I know, I haven't forgotten.

441
00:33:24,523 --> 00:33:27,360
As long as you know, Maquia.

to be a parade,

446
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,103
a massive festival to celebrate
the prince's wedding.

447
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:05,815
Two different processions,
one with the prince
and one with Leilia,

448
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:10,069
will leave from separate
palaces, both of them
crossing this bridge.

449
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,155
Here, we'll stage an attack
on the prince and his Renato,

450
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,408
cause all the chaos we can,

451
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:18,327
and when the guard protecting
Leilia weakens to support
the prince,

452
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:21,163
we take Leilia back.

453
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:23,749
I wanna see the parade, too.

sweetheart, maybe next time.

I know when we're here.

today the blood of the Iorph
is bonded to the royal family.

465

The Renato and the Iorph,

these legends that endure
unto our era,

467

can join their power
with Mezarte!

00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:44,700
[Maquia] Leilia.
Leilia.

483
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,418
Hm?

484
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:55,961
Sorry, sir.

485
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,553
I've missed you.

486
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:09,850
Maquia, what are you doing here?

487
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,895
Not just me, Krim, too.

488
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:14,313
Krim is here in the city?

489
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:16,106
We came to save you.

490
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:18,317
Come on, everybody's
waiting for...

491
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:22,780
-Leilia?
-I'm sorry, I can't just leave.

492
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,823
But why not?

493
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,910
I can't escape.

494
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,913
You can, you were
the fastest of anybody.

495
00:38:30,913 --> 00:38:34,541
You can just fly
over these castle walls
and be gone, Leilia.

496
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:43,842
[gasps]

497
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:47,972
I can't...
I can't see Krim again.

498
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:50,808
But then you...

499
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,894
-Leilia, you--
-[Izor] Your Highness!

500
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:56,939
You have to run, Maquia, now!

501
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:59,233
But I-- Leilia, no.

502
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:02,861
Go now, I'll be OK.
After all, I can fly, right?

503
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:04,947
[Izor] Hold fast!

504
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:10,995
[gasps]

505
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,877
My lady.

506
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:23,173
-Get them.
-Hold!
If you lay a finger on her--

507
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:25,926
[crown clatters]

508
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:35,602
As you wish, my lady.

509
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:46,989
I can fly, I know it.

510
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:56,707
-[man] So,
how big's the kid now?

511
00:39:56,707 --> 00:39:59,793
He should be about
six or seven, yeah?

512
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:03,339
So, how's the world treating ya?

513
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:07,426
You're one of us.
You're an Iorph.

514
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:09,511
[chuckles] Only about half.

515
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:13,682
Racine, the elder,
there's a reason
she made it taboo

516
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:17,186
for any Iorph to
leave the village.

517
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:18,812
She knew what would happen.

518
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:21,774
She knew the fate of those
that are different.

519
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:25,027
Humans always play
the same part,

520
00:40:25,027 --> 00:40:27,571
first they stare,
then they taunt.

521
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:31,617
One day, they hate,
eventually, they kill.

522
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:35,079
So, the Clan remains
separated,

523
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,541
and always just out of step
with the rhythms of the world.

524
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,756
Try to live an ordinary life.

525
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,188
[door opens]

526
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,693
Krim, you're hurt.

527
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:15,411
Would you take off
the cloak for me?

528
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:23,043
[Krim] What does it mean
to be a child?

529
00:41:23,043 --> 00:41:24,545
What?

530
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:27,214
What does it mean
to be a mother?

531
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:31,927
[Maquia] I wonder
if I even know.

532
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:37,975
At times,
Mido would try to explain it.

533
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:40,644
She'd help me out so much,

534
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:43,647
sometimes I felt
like a little sister,

535
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:46,733
but that's not quite it.

536
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:49,903
I know that I'm really happy

537
00:41:49,903 --> 00:41:53,490
whenever Erial laughs or smiles

538
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,578
and when I look at him,
everything else in the world
just falls away

539
00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:59,788
and I just wanna hold him--

540
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:02,458
That makes no sense.

541
00:42:04,293 --> 00:42:06,628
Erial will die long before you.

542
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:07,838
[gasps]

543
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,048
It's the truth.

544
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:12,759
Erial is going
to leave you alone.

545
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,387
[stifles a sob]

546
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,264
[door bangs]

547
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:20,434
-Don't make my mom cry!
-Erial, no! He's just--

548
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:24,646
-I'Il make you cry.
-Eria|, please stop it.

549
00:42:24,646 --> 00:42:26,940
Can you protect him?

550
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,278
Can you?
When it really matters?

551
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:33,447
Huh?

552
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:56,512
[Krim] We will stay in Mezarte,
we will save Leilia.

553
00:42:56,512 --> 00:42:59,765
You and your child
will only get in the way.

554
00:42:59,765 --> 00:43:05,437
I am sorry, Maquia,
this is goodbye.

555
00:43:07,523 --> 00:43:08,941
[Erial] Are we gonna go home?

556
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:12,653
[Maquia] No,
we're not going home.

557
00:43:12,653 --> 00:43:15,864
[Erial] But why not?

558
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:19,493
[Maquia] We are going somewhere
new, just the two of us.

559
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:25,415
[Erial] Somewhere brand new?
You mean without Mido or Lang
or anybody from home?

560
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:27,251
[Maquia] I'm sorry, Erial,

561
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:30,420
I don't think you'll be able
to see them again.

562
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,549
[Erial] Well, as long as
I'm with you, I'm OK.

563
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:36,426
[Maquia] Me too.

564
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:38,762
I'm happy,
as long as I'm with you.

565
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:42,849
No chance, girlie.
I know trouble when I see it.

566
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:46,728
Can't have you running off
when whatever trouble it is
comes knocking.

567
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,232
-Ohh!
[Maquia] Erial!

568
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:53,694
I'm so sorry!

569
00:43:53,694 --> 00:43:55,904
[man] You brat!
You'd better run!

570
00:43:55,904 --> 00:43:57,698
Don't come back!

571
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,242
[Maquia] Mom's gonna try
a few more places, all right?

572
00:44:00,242 --> 00:44:02,077
You wait at the inn for me.

573
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:04,288
Aww, I don't want to.

574
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:06,498
Please, Erial, will you wait?

575
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:13,463
I really can't thank you enough.

576
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:16,383
The bar does all
its best business at night.

577
00:44:16,383 --> 00:44:18,635
You'll probably be working
pretty late.

578
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:20,095
You don't mind?

579
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,639
How late do you mean?

580
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,474
[woman] Got a problem?

581
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:27,269
Just, my son is--
He's young.

582
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:30,814
-I'd rather not leave him alone
if I don't have to--
-[groans]

583
00:44:30,814 --> 00:44:35,444
We just had another
girl take off with the same
problem, you're too young.

584
00:44:35,444 --> 00:44:38,363
-You'd better think about this.
-But you don't--

585
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:40,198
Don't what?

586
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:43,744
Tell me, you need to be a better
example than this to your child!

587
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:48,957
Go on then, I don't have
any work for someone like you.

588
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:06,600
Welcome home, Mommy!

589
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,144
Hello, sweetie.

590
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:14,316
Mom, come here. Look! look!

591
00:45:14,316 --> 00:45:17,235
I made you some Hibial.

592
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:23,283
-Why'd you give me more to do?
-Hm?

593
00:45:23,283 --> 00:45:25,869
Why did you take all this out?

594
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:30,374
Because I wanted to show you
what I made.

595
00:45:30,374 --> 00:45:32,376
Can't you just listen to me
for once, Erial!

596
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:36,254
-Huh?
-Always! You're always
making problems.

597
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:38,256
If I don't work
then we can't eat,

598
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:40,717
we cannot survive like this.

599
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:44,888
-Mommy...
-You make everything so hard.

600
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:46,807
Why, Erial?

601
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:49,726
The tickle bugs are coming.

602
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:53,188
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

603
00:45:53,188 --> 00:45:55,857
I bought some dinner,
come and eat.

604
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:00,362
Erial, wait!

605
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,125
I... I'm not a mother

606
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:16,211
I don't have a right to be.

607
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:18,171
I don't deserve it.

608
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:21,967
All this time,
I've just been pretending.

609
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:24,761
Mido was always there
to catch me.

610
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:30,892
You must never fall in love,
for if you do,
then you shall truly be alone.

611
00:46:30,892 --> 00:46:33,728
Truly alone.

612
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:36,523
Elder.

613
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,539
"My mommy".

614
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:56,626
[Erial] My mommy.

615
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:01,882
[rain pattering]

616
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:11,433
Erial!

617
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:17,439
Erial!

618
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:19,774
Erial, where are you?

619
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:21,693
Erial!

620
00:47:23,612 --> 00:47:25,572
Erial, please!

621
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:28,033
[Erial] Mommy!

622
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:30,202
[Maquia] Erial!

623
00:47:36,082 --> 00:47:37,792
[Erial] I tricked you.

624
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:41,129
You thought I shed my skin,
right?

625
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:46,551
[laughing]

626
00:47:46,551 --> 00:47:49,679
-You shed your skin.
-I made you laugh.

627
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,516
-Wha-- Oh.
-Got you!

628
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:58,480
Silly boy.

629
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,398
[Erial] Mommy?

630
00:48:00,398 --> 00:48:05,320
I wish... I wish that you
could stay like this forever.

631
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:08,156
Nuh-uh.

632
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,328
If I don't get bigger,
how will I protect you?

633
00:48:13,328 --> 00:48:18,333
[crying]

634
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,127
I didn't want you to cry.

635
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:24,756
Then I won't cry again.

636
00:48:24,756 --> 00:48:26,925
After all, I'm a mom.

637
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,264
You promise me?

638
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:33,848
Uh-huh.

639
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:44,276
You promise, too.
OK, Erial?

640
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:46,444
Yeah, I promise.

641
00:48:46,444 --> 00:48:50,115
Mom, I'll always protect you.

642
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:07,299
Keep going, slowly now.

643
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,634
[machinery grinding]

644
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:29,362
[people chattering]

645
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:33,533
All right, order up!
Maquia!

646
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:35,493
Coming!

647
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:42,083
And this one's on you,
you're paying me back
for the other day.

648
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,127
[chattering]

649
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:49,841
It takes a lot of experience
to get it perfect like this.

650
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:56,598
And that's why I told you,
you had to cut it out.

651
00:49:56,598 --> 00:49:59,225
I kinda thought
it was all going to turn out OK.

652
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:01,478
[Maquia] Welcome,
there's a table at the back.

653
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:07,108
Maquia, three kelbi, yeah?

654
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:09,152
-Sure.
-I'lI take that, sweetie.

655
00:50:09,152 --> 00:50:12,447
-Right away.
-I'll take another one, too.

656
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:16,117
Your sister's got quite a butt
on her.

657
00:50:16,117 --> 00:50:20,038
I never noticed.

658
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:23,958
The two of them hardly
look alike at all, right?

659
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:28,672
Yeah, very suspicious how
you just came out of nowhere.

660
00:50:28,672 --> 00:50:30,382
Where'd you say
you moved from again?

661
00:50:30,382 --> 00:50:31,841
Huh?

662
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:34,761
Maybe you two ain't
brother and sister at all,

663
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:37,806
just two crazy kids
who went and eloped together.

664
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:40,809
-Sorry for the wait.
-Oh, yes!

665
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:43,853
Let me know
if you need anything else.

666
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:46,481
Welcome.

667
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:52,237
-Hmm...
-They keep getting new recruits.

668
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:55,573
How many guards
do they actually need on watch?

669
00:50:55,573 --> 00:50:58,034
Iron's the most important
resource we got.

670
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:01,162
Mezarte keeps making cannons
and we keep getting fed,

671
00:51:01,162 --> 00:51:03,289
I wouldn't call it
a terrible deal.

672
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:06,960
[playing up-tempo tune]

673
00:51:22,142 --> 00:51:24,686
[boy] You don't think
it's all a bit suspicious?

674
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:27,605
It's almost like
they're just waiting for
another war to break out.

675
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:30,567
Do you think that idiot prince
can command our military?

676
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:31,818
Not a chance.

677
00:51:37,866 --> 00:51:41,327
It can get a tad raucous
in here, sorry it's so loud.

678
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:44,247
Here's what we're serving
from the kitchen today.

679
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:55,550
Maquia!

680
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,218
Lang, it's you!

681
00:51:57,218 --> 00:52:00,430
-[both laughing]
-I can't believe it's you!

682
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,807
You haven't aged a day,
makes sense.

683
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:04,559
Well, what about you, Lang?

684
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,562
Look how tall you are,
like you could touch the sun.

685
00:52:07,562 --> 00:52:09,939
Come on,
I'm not a stalk of wheat.

686
00:52:09,939 --> 00:52:13,651
[laughs] Erial! Hey, Erial!

687
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:18,490
Look up here!
It's Lang! Lang is here!

688
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,658
Hey, Erial!

689
00:52:20,658 --> 00:52:22,744
Huh?

690
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:33,505
[Lang] Are you sure it's
all right for me to be here?

691
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:36,424
[Maquia] Of course.
Sorry about the mess.

692
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:38,051
Tell me more.

693
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:40,136
Are Mido and Deol doing well?

694
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:44,974
Yeah, except cities like Durell
are the only ones
with an economy.

695
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:47,644
All the old rural areas
are dying out.

696
00:52:47,644 --> 00:52:50,939
Deol left as well.
Ah, thank you.

697
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:53,107
Deol's looking for work too?

698
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:55,318
[Lang] Well,
can't live without it.

699
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:58,780
OK, I'm gonna take off.

700
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,533
Ha-ha, what's that?
Got yourself a date tonight?

701
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:04,619
Sure, deep in the mines.

702
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,372
Be safe, OK?
I'll see you later.

703
00:53:07,372 --> 00:53:10,250
I'll make some dinner
when you get back.

704
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:17,298
[Maquia sighs]

705
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,719
He got a job when we first
arrived here,

706
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:24,430
and he works incredibly hard.

707
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,182
Of course.

708
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:28,560
And we can't just keep
selling the Hibial.

709
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,731
Plus, because of me,
it's hard to stay in one place
for too long.

710
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,236
I see. Makes sense.

711
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:41,823
So he finally realized
you weren't bound by blood.

712
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:43,241
How'd he take it?

713
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:48,872
Five years ago,

714
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:52,292
he told me he didn't want me
sleeping next to him anymore.

715
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:55,920
Not too long after, he stopped
calling me "Mom", too.

716
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,259
"Hey" or "Come here", that's it.
That's all he says.

717
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:04,512
I did the same thing.
It's just a phase.

718
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:09,976
Lang, have you heard
anything about Leilia?

719
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:21,863
Another lost to the red eye.

720
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:23,907
[Low growl]

721
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:27,327
[Izor] Burn it to the bones.
Bury it deep.

722
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:34,250
-Scary.
-There's nothing to fear,
Princess Medmel.

723
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,919
Um, where's my father?

724
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:38,546
His Highness Prince Hazel
is currently occupied.

725
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:40,882
[groans]

726
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:43,343
And Mother?

727
00:54:43,343 --> 00:54:45,303
What about your mother?

728
00:54:45,303 --> 00:54:46,721
[sighs]

729
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:50,391
Sorry, it's nothing.

730
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:52,602
[man] Hair the color
of a dawning moon,

731
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:54,312
golden rings within the cornea,

732
00:54:54,312 --> 00:54:56,064
and, allegedly,
a low body temperature

733
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:58,316
are the signs
of the Iorph people.

734
00:54:58,316 --> 00:55:02,445
I regret to say, Princess Medmel
shows almost none of these
traits, Your Majesty.

735
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:04,489
So, if she won't
live a long life

736
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:09,160
or bear a son, then why have
I kept that monster in my home?

737
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,748
[man] Hmm. I feel it will be
difficult for Leilia to produce
another child.

738
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:17,794
Not to mention, Prince Hazel
seems to have grown tired
of her as well.

739
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:21,381
Oh, my poor, beloved Hazel.

740
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:25,426
Do something! At least
go find my son another woman.

741
00:55:25,426 --> 00:55:29,180
My liege, we are currently
seeking survivors of the Iorph.

742
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,350
No doubt they will produce
a better heir.

743
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,311
-Enough!
-[woman] Princess Leila!

744
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:37,981
If he has no desire
to speak to me

745
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:41,067
until I'm weighed down
with all this filth,

746
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,486
then just be rid of me!

747
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:44,779
[sobbing]

748
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:49,367
[woman] Her Highness is--

749
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:51,744
I will speak with her alone.

750
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,961
-[Leilia] Another Renato
has died?
-Yes.

751
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:04,173
I have been locked in this tower

752
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:07,844
since the day
I gave birth to Medmel.

753
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:11,389
And I am never allowed
to see either of them.

754
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,475
The same...

755
00:56:14,475 --> 00:56:17,186
the Renato and I
are the same.

756
00:56:17,186 --> 00:56:21,941
We're vapors, things only meant
to exist and live in memory.

757
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:25,987
The clan that flew the skies,

758
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:28,364
flowers that sung at day break,

759
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:31,451
they were not meant
for this world.

760
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:34,078
There must be a way to resist.

761
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,664
A way for the legends
to survive the night.

762
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,585
To survive?

763
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:44,881
You dare say those words?

764
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:47,216
You murdered them.

765
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,469
[heartbeats thumping]

766
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:07,153
My lady, I beg
for your forgiveness.

767
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:08,613
You can burn!

768
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:12,742
Let me see my daughter!

769
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:15,369
Why can't I see her?

770
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,371
I brought her into this world.

771
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:23,294
I've almost
forgotten her scent.

772
00:57:23,294 --> 00:57:27,215
How soft she was
when I held her.

773
00:57:27,215 --> 00:57:32,762
Izor, how much must you
take from me
before you are satisfied?

774
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:38,309
You take everything
and I am alone.

775
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:44,524
If you won't let me see Medmel,
then bring me Maquia.

776
00:57:46,526 --> 00:57:50,279
Please, bring me Maquia.

777
00:57:50,863 --> 00:57:52,240
[sobbing] I...

778
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,077
I don't want
to be alone anymore.

779
00:58:07,547 --> 00:58:09,674
You never cleaned
like this before.

780
00:58:09,674 --> 00:58:12,385
It's been you and me
for so long,

781
00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:15,012
we've never had
any company over before.

782
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,686
Hey, help me?

783
00:58:31,404 --> 00:58:32,905
You've gotten so tall.

784
00:58:32,905 --> 00:58:35,449
I guess so.

785
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,415
-[chattering]
-Maquia, I need to talk to you.

786
00:58:42,415 --> 00:58:45,126
Will you have time
when your shift is over?

787
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:46,961
Yeah, I think so.

788
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:49,005
I'll be around
once you finish then.

789
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:51,591
[man] Maquia,
got an order coming up.

790
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:53,009
OK.

791
00:58:56,888 --> 00:59:01,601
[boy] Man, I thought
she was your girl,
so I never made a move.

792
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,394
[boy] Same here.

793
00:59:03,394 --> 00:59:06,314
[man] Come on, lads, there's
plenty of fish in the sea.

794
00:59:06,314 --> 00:59:09,734
-[all laughing]
-But why does that jerk
get this fish?

795
00:59:09,734 --> 00:59:13,821
-[Erial] She's not like that.
-Oh... Yeah?

796

for me?

Lang, if something were
to happen to your mom or
your brother, I just couldn't.

-Maquia, I want you
to be trouble.
-Huh?

817
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:34,360
Ever since I was little, I would
do anything for you, Maquia.

818
01:00:36,195 --> 01:00:38,322
Just think about it.

I'm so sorry.

thinking about my Erial.

we stay together?",

"How can I become
a true mother to him?"

And I don't see myself finding
the answers anytime soon.

I've never had
that kind of wisdom

829
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:38,758
but that's all I want,

830
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:43,220

to think about my son.

help you find a new home,

can be safe.

Are you all right?

Can you stand?

[Erial] They thought...

01:03:00,714 --> 01:03:04,427
everyone thought
we had eloped together.

was gonna take you away.

treat me like a kid?!

going to be my child.

Would you consider hiring me
as a castle solider?

01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:49,469
Your hair's gotten so long.

956
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:54,057
Back in the village, we were
only permitted hair past
our waist if we had a child.

957
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:59,229
Come, Maquia,
we're going to rescue Leilia.

958
01:13:06,778 --> 01:13:08,572
[Maquia] Will there be war?

959
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:12,409
Only a moment of suffering
for people like us.

960
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:16,663
Nothing to the pain
you must have known these years.

961
01:13:16,663 --> 01:13:20,625
Abandoning the Iorph,
wandering the world
with nothing.

962
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:25,046
Lost and alone,
as if you'd died alive.

963
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:29,926
So... you know how we feel,
don't you?

964
01:13:29,926 --> 01:13:32,220
The Clan of the Separated,

965
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,390
the elder must be long gone
and passed into shadow.

966
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:40,187
Everything we have ever known
has faded away.

967
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:45,025
And you, you left it all behind
for your own world.

968
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:50,155
The Iorph work as one,
the Iorph weave one cloth.

969
01:13:50,155 --> 01:13:52,032
You and me and Leilia,

970
01:13:52,032 --> 01:13:54,826
we cannot weave
different histories.

971

[knife cutting]

972
01:14:05,128 --> 01:14:08,256
Congratulations, Maquia,
you're home,

973
01:14:08,256 --> 01:14:10,717
we have severed
the final thread.

974
01:14:10,717 --> 01:14:15,180
We begin anew,
weaving one future.

-Dita!
-Huh?

977
01:14:37,828 --> 01:14:40,956
[Dita] Erial, welcome home!

978
01:14:45,877 --> 01:14:48,255
You're home pretty early today.

979
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:51,258
I'm sorry I'm so busy
right when you need me the most.

980
01:14:51,258 --> 01:14:54,886
Don't you worry,
we still have plenty of time.

981
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:57,931
I know,
but I still worry anyway.

982
01:14:57,931 --> 01:14:59,933
I'll get dinner started.

983
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:03,478
No, no. I got it,
you should be resting.

984
01:15:03,478 --> 01:15:06,231
It's better if
I move around a bit.

985
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:10,735
I'm fine. Sit down, sit down.

986
01:15:10,735 --> 01:15:12,237
[Erial] OK.

987
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:18,034
Do you think it's odd
how we came together?

988
01:15:18,034 --> 01:15:19,703
[Erial] Sometimes.

989

Came here to Mezarte.

990

Who could have imagined
I'd meet you again?

991
01:15:26,626 --> 01:15:28,670
And now...

992
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:35,594
Hey, Erial, was I truly
the right one for you?

993
01:15:37,888 --> 01:15:39,806
Hmm?
What did you say?

I'll be back, I promise.

-Sorry, sir.

1004

[cannons booming]

1009
01:17:10,188 --> 01:17:15,777
[Hazel] Mezarte exploited
ancient powers as a show
of unstoppable might

1010
01:17:15,777 --> 01:17:18,530
and now the nations
that surround us

1011
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:22,117
have forged alliances
and furled condemnations,

1012
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:25,704
all to tear down Mezarte's
abuse of those ancient powers.

[King] Where is
my High Minister?

1015
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,175
He's already
fled the castle,

1016
01:17:39,175 --> 01:17:41,386
along with many of your
retainers, Your Majesty.

1017
01:17:41,386 --> 01:17:44,347
Has he abandoned me
in my time of need?

1018
01:17:44,347 --> 01:17:46,850
What must I endure?

1019
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:51,021
It's all over,
the kingdom falls.

1020
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:53,231
Majesty, you have to move.

1021
01:17:53,231 --> 01:17:56,317
Go. I'll return and
find Princess Medmel.

1022

Silence, you fool,
I have no daughter.

You're alive?

No, it's not real.

You're a ghost.

I am going
to make them suffer,

I'm going to make them pay
for hurting you.

Then I'll wipe it all clean,
everything.

What are you saying?

You taught me what it means
to love someone.

01:31:48,315 --> 01:31:50,442
I tried to do
all I could for you,

01:31:50,442 --> 01:31:54,071
but you were the one
who ended up caring for me.

1216
01:31:56,282 --> 01:31:59,159
When I first laid eyes on you
that night,

1217
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,412
I thought you would cry with me,

1218

share my sorrow.

1219
01:32:02,871 --> 01:32:07,167
I thought that you
would be my Hibial,

1220
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:11,589
but then, every moment
I spent with you,

1221
01:32:11,589 --> 01:32:16,010
all the sadness, all the pain,

1222
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,345
it all went away.

1223
01:32:19,388 --> 01:32:20,973
Still, I...

1224
01:32:20,973 --> 01:32:23,809
I left, I failed you.

1225
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:28,230
You could never,
ever fail me, Erial.

1226
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:32,484
Despite what you think,
you did keep your promise to me.

1227
01:32:32,484 --> 01:32:34,862
You've been here,

1228
01:32:34,862 --> 01:32:38,490
protecting me
this entire time.

1229
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:42,036
Even alone, even if
we were separated,

1230
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:45,247
whenever I didn't know
what to do with myself,

1231
01:32:45,247 --> 01:32:48,876
you were there,
I would always think of you...

1232
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,254
and everything was OK.

1233
01:32:53,297 --> 01:32:55,507
So if you call my name,

1234
01:32:55,507 --> 01:32:58,093
even if it isn't "Mom"...

1235

whatever name you choose,

1236
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:03,682
I swear to you, Erial,

1237
01:33:03,682 --> 01:33:05,768
that name will become mine.

1238

You wove me together, Erial...
